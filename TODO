Figure out how to automatically match people up. There will need to be a backend that takes care of this. I think there will be two endpoints. Join a room, Make a room. 

If there are too many people making rooms, there is no issue. There will simply be an abundant amount of rooms for users to switch between. 

If there are too many people joining rooms, there is also no issue. We can simply pair them up. 

it could be like hot potato. When you leave, you toss the potato. The other person will be left with the code. I like that. 

Will likely need moderation in some way? Figure that out later for sure.
